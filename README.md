### How a deeper software model enables breakthroughs in product development            

Most products start with an initial software model, a model that is usually naive and superficial, based on shallow knowledge. This makes sense because you just started discovering and exploring that new product. So we typically start by identifying nouns and verbs and using these as the initial objects and methods to build in our code. While the initial model helps you start getting fast feedback for your product,  once you get more feedback most of the time it isn’t a helpful model anymore. They usually don’t provide a rational expression of the primary concerns of the domain experts anymore as time progresses to build that product. Not having that expression can hold you back from making essential breakthroughs for your product, breakthroughs that can be the differentiation factor in the market. And even worse, implementing the model in code might not even support making these new breakthroughs.

Join us in this talk, where we present to you why we think it is crucial for the core model of your product to be continuously refactored towards a deeper model. We begin with a short introduction and the  origin of Domain-Driven Design and model-driven design. Then we will explain the concepts of deep modeling, and why tactical patterns with a Supple design are essential to doing deep modeling. We will dive into a concrete example, worked out with the model exploration whirlpool and collaborative modeling practices like EventStorming, Example Mapping,  and Responsibility mapping based on CRC cards. Finally, we dive into the code and show how we can get breakthroughs by continuously refactoring to deeper insights with a supple design getting a deep model.

### Kenny Baas-Schwegler
Kenny Baas-Schwegler is a Software Engineer and Consultant focusing on software quality at Xebia. He mentors and coaches teams using practices and techniques from Domain Driven Design, Behaviour Driven Development, Test Driven Development, and Continuous Delivery.

He is an advocate for multidisciplinary collaboration in open spaces. Using techniques such as Event Storming, and Example Mapping, he helps engineer requirements to design and model software. With these methods, he aims to create a transparent, collaborative domain space with constant and instant feedback when delivering software.

Besides daily work, he helps organize meetups for Behaviour Driven Development NL and Domain Driven Design Nederland.

### Bruno Boucard
Bruno Boucard is a developer, trainer, agile coach, and speaker. He loves to explain with concrete examples with live coding if needed. He is the organizer of the BDD Paris user group. He is a long-time Microsoft MVP, but he still is coding Java with a C# accent ;-)

His company, 42skillz aims to help organizations to make software and to work differently, he provides training, coaching, and consulting about TDD, BDD, legacy code refactoring techniques, DDD, and Team Topologies with an extra soul.
